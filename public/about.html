<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Dhukel Sherpa, only child of Mr. Nima Sherpa and Mrs. Sonu Sherpa. I am from the country of the himalayas, Nepal. I am very much in love with computers and i want to build my career in the field of IT. However, I haven't yet decided on what field of Programming I really want to work. But I want to start it with the full stack developer and explore more fields and find my interests later on.  </p>

<p>Till the date, I only see my future working as a programmer, however this wasn't the same from the beginning. When i was still at the grade 10 in school, I wanted to become civil engineer, but one day, when my teacher gave us some coding exercise and i was first to complete it, my teacher told me that I could become a very good programmer which made me think of my career. Since then I started enjoying writing programs. And after the end of my school, I chose Computer Science as my major subject in +2 level and made my mind to study and work in this field.</p>

<p>Chosing computer science over other subject was a great choice. But harder part was to stay focused and motivated as programming can not always be fun and it is not an easy subject. Therefore, I always keep finding motivation to learn more and stay consistence in learning. But that itself is not as easy as I thought. Therefore, I keep seeking for motivation to be consistence in learning. I'm still very far from being a good programmer and start earning. But, I beleive I can do much better and reach my goals.  </p>
